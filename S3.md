# S3 - Simple Storage Service
S3 is one of the main building blocks on AWS, advertised as infinite scaling storage
Many websites use s3 as a backbone
#### Use Cases
- back up and storage
- disaster recovery purpose
- archive purposes
- hybrid cloud storage
- application hosting
- media hosting
- data lakes & big data analytics
- software delivery
- static website
# Buckets
- s3 stores objects (files) in buckets (directories)
- buckets must have a globally unique name - across all region and all accounts
- buckets are defined at the region level
- looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- naming convention
	- no uppercase or underscores
	- 3-62 chars
	- not an ip
	- must start with lowercase letter or a num
	- not start with prefix
	- not end with suffix
## Objects
- files. - have a key
- the key is the full path if nested in folders
- key is composed of prefix and object name
- no concept of directories
	- ui will trick you
- everything in s3 is a key
- values are content of body
- max obj size 5tb
- more than 5gb - use multi part upload
- metadata
	- list of key/val pair
- tags - unicode key/val pair up to 10
- version id - if versioning enabled

## Bucket Policy - Security
- user based - iam policies
- resource based security
	- bucket policies
	- allows cross accounts
	- Object ACL - finer grain
	- Bucket ACL - less common
- an Iam principal can access an s3 object
	- if iam perms allow it OR resource policy allows it
	- no explicit deny
- JSON based policies
	- resource block
	- effect
		- allow or deny
	- principal
		- account or user to apply to
	- Action
		- set of api to allow or deny GET etc
- use iam roles if you need ec2 access
- cross account access must use bucket policy
- settings to block public access
	- prevent company data leaks
	- can be set at account level

## Website Overview
**Static website**
- can host static sites
## S3 Versioning
- version files
- enabled at bucket level
- same key overwrite will change version
- best practice to version
	- easy roll back
	- restore prev version
- any file not versioned prior will have version null

## Replication
- CRR cross region
- SRR same region
- copying is async
- must give proper iam perms
- use cases
	- crr - compliance lower latency
	- srr - log aggregation, live replication between test and prod
- after you enable replication only new objects are replicated
	- optional - you can replicate existing object using s3 batch replication
- can replicate delete markers
	- **delete marker replication will delete in other buckets as well
	- deletes are not replicated
- no chaining of replications
## Storage 
- s3 standard
- infrequent access
- one zone infreq access
- glacier instant
- glacier
- flexible
- glacier deep archive
- intelligent tiering
- can move between classes manually or s3 lifecycles
### Durable 11 9's
- on avg 10,000,000 objs - incur a loss of a single obj once every 10k years
- same for all storage classes
- **Availability
	- measures how readily avail a service is
	- varies on class
	- standard has 99.99% avail = not avail 53 mins a year
### Standard
- frequently accessed data
- low latency
- sustain 2 concurrent facilities
- use case
	- big data analytics
	- mobile and gaming apps
	- content dist.
### Infrequent Access
- less freq access but requires rapid access
- 99.99% avail
- cost on retrieval
- use case
	- recovery
	- backups
- **One Zone IA
	- high durability in a single AZ, data lost when destroyed
	- 99.5% avail
	- use case
		- secondary backups
### Glacier
- price per storage and retrieval
- meant for archiving / back up
- **Glacier Instant Retrieval
	- millisecond retr.
	- min storage duration 90 days
- **Glacier Flexible
	- expedited 1 - 5 mins
	- standard 3-5 hrs
	- bulk 5 - 12 hrs
	- all free
	- min storage duration 90 days
- **Glacier Deep Archive
	- long term storage
	- 12 hours standard - bulk 48 hrs
	- min duration 180 days
### Intelligent - Tiering
- small monthly monitoring and auto tiering fee
- moves objs auto between tiers based on usage
- freq - default
- infreq - not acc for 30 days
- arch instant access - not acc for 90 days
- arch acc - from 90 - 700+ days
